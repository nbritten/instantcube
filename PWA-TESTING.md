## üîç Troubleshooting

### Service Worker Not Registering

**Symptom:** No service worker in DevTools
**Fix:**
- Make sure you ran `npm run build` (not `npm run dev`)
- Service workers only work in production builds
- Check browser console for errors

### "Offline" Mode Not Working

**Symptom:** App shows error when offline
**Fix:**
- Visit app while online first (to cache assets)
- Check Cache Storage in DevTools has cached files
- Reload page to ensure service worker is active

### Install Prompt Not Showing

**Symptom:** No install button appears
**Fix:**
- PWA install prompts only work on HTTPS (or localhost)
- Chrome hides prompt if previously dismissed
- Try in Incognito mode
- Check manifest.json is valid in DevTools

### Icons Not Loading

**Symptom:** Manifest shows missing icons
**Fix:**
- Verify `/public/icon-192.png` and `/public/icon-512.png` exist
- Rebuild with `npm run build`
- Check browser Network tab for 404s
